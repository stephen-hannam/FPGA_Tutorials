## Priority Encoder Tutorial

### Upon Completion

Upon completion of this tutorial you will be able to:

* Describe the expected 'black-boxed' behaviour of a hardware priority-encoder
* Understand how priority is inferred in if-elsif-else constructs
* Infer priority resolving constructs using VHDL/verilog for loops
* Understand why non-process loops are wrong for creating priority encoders
* Instantiate a verilog module in a VHDL architecture block

### Background

#### Priority Encoder Truth Table

NB: Excellent summary of how the 'compiler'/synth-tool interprets the code given by [user Brian Drummond at StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14113125/short-way-to-write-vhdl-priority-encoder). I am also using the code he provides in his comment.

1. Simulation
2. Block Diagrams
  1. Post-Elaboartion
  2. Post-Implementation
3. Hardware
